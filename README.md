# Correct Guess
If the user gives a letter that is correct, it will give a correct statement and show the word again with the letters that have been correctly guessed.

# Correct Word
If the user guesses all the letters, it will confirm the word was completed and then provide a new word to start guessing again.

# Out of Guesses
If the user runs out of guesses before guessing the word, they will be prompted with a message and what the word was. It will then ask if they would like to continue playing. If yes, the game will provide a new word to guess. If no, it will end the game.

# Previously Guessed Letter
If the letter guessed was already used, the game will say state the letter has already been guessed and ask for a new one not already used.
